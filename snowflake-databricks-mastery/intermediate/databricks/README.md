## 💡 Key Concepts

### Delta Lake
Open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to data lakes:
- Reliability with transactions
- Time travel capabilities
- Schema enforcement and evolution
- Unified batch and streaming

### Structured Streaming
Scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing:
- Micro-batch or continuous processing
- Exactly-once semantics
- Integration with Delta Lake
- Event-time processing

### MLflow
Open-source platform for ML lifecycle:
- Experiment tracking
- Model registry
- Model deployment
- Reproducibility

## 📊 Real-World Use Cases
