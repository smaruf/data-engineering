# Personalized Plan: Becoming a Successful AI Prompt Engineer

Hi!  
Based on your GitHub profile ([smaruf](https://github.com/smaruf)), hereâ€™s a tailored plan to help you become a successful AI prompt engineer, leveraging your current skills and projects:

---

## 1. **Leverage Your Strong Coding Background**
- You have broad experience with Ruby, Rails, Django, JavaScript, and more.  
  **Action:** Use this polyglot background to create multi-language prompt scenarios and test AI outputs for various frameworks and styles.
- Example repos:  
  - [rails](https://github.com/josh/rails)
  - [django-mptt](https://github.com/brosner/django-mptt)
  - [sinatra](https://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra)

## 2. **Start Practicing Prompt Engineering Techniques**
- **Action:** Regularly write, test, and iterate on prompts using tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar LLMs.
- Focus on:
  - Writing clear, specific prompts for code generation, review, and refactoring.
  - Experimenting with temperature, role, and context in prompts.
  - Documenting which prompts work best for different scenarios.

## 3. **Document and Share Learnings**
- **Action:** Create a dedicated repository (e.g., `prompt-engineering-lab`) where you:
  - Share effective prompt templates.
  - Document prompt experiments and results.
  - Open source your prompt engineering best practices.

## 4. **Explore AI/ML Repos and Integrations**
- Your repo list suggests some work with APIs and system integrations.
  **Action:** Start integrating LLM APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.) into your own projects.  
  - Create tools or plugins that automate code reviews or generate documentation using AI.

## 5. **Contribute to Open Source AI Prompt Projects**
- **Action:** Find and contribute to public repositories focused on prompt engineering and LLM applications.
- Collaborate with the community: review PRs, suggest improvements, and share your own prompt experiments.

## 6. **Develop a Prompt Engineering Portfolio**
- **Action:** Document your learning path and showcase prompt engineering achievements:
  - Blog posts (your [LinkedIn](https://bd.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-shamsul-maruf-79905161) or GitHub Pages)
  - Repo READMEs with prompt case studies and before/after examples
  - Workshops, talks, or recorded demos

## 7. **Continue Learning and Stay Updated**
- **Action:** Subscribe to leading newsletters, blogs, and GitHub repos on prompt engineering and AI, such as:
  - [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
  - [Papers with Code: Prompt Engineering](https://paperswithcode.com/task/prompt-engineering)
- Take online courses or attend webinars about LLMs and prompt design.

---

## **Gap Analysis & Recommendations**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Broad programming experience
  - Eagerness to learn new concepts
  - Open-source contributions

- **Growth Areas:**  
  - Hands-on work with LLM APIs and prompt testing
  - Systematic documentation and sharing of prompt engineering insights
  - Community engagement in the AI/prompt engineering space

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Set up a `prompt-engineering-lab` repo and start documenting experiments.
2. Integrate an LLM API into a side project.
3. Write a blog post or README about your first successful (or failed!) prompt experiment.
4. Join relevant AI/prompt engineering forums or Discord servers.
